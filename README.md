GitHub (/ˈɡɪthʌb/) is a proprietary developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code. It uses Git to provide distributed version control and GitHub itself provides access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project. GitHub is operated by Github, Inc., a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018 which is headquartered in San Francisco.

It is commonly used to host open source software development projects. As of January 2023, GitHub reported having over 100 million developers and more than 420 million repositories, including at least 28 million public repositories. It is the world's largest source code host as of June 2023. Over five billion developer contributions were made to more than 500 million open source projects in 2024.

# About

Founding
The development of the GitHub platform began on October 19, 2007. The site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chacon after it had been available for a few months as a beta release.

Structure of the organization
GitHub was originally a flat organization with no middle managers, instead relying on self-management. Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them (open allocation), but the chief executive set salaries.
